\section{Regression Tests}

These are tests which exercise the code as a simulation tool rather than individual functions. These tests should confirm that the code is capable of solving the required ordinary and partial differential equations which are posed to it. Examples of simulations which meet this criteria are exercises of complex constitutive models, single or multi-element simulations of analytic or method of manufactured solutions type problems, and exercises of multi-field/physics capabilities.
