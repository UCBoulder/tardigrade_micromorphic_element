\section{Unit Tests}

The subroutines involved in the calculations which can be verified to be functioning as intended via small, controlled, tests are contained here. These are typically utility functions, the gradients and other derivatives of deformation metrics and stresses, and other low level commands. While crucial for the computation of the finite element simulation, they are not verifications of the code in terms of its overall capabilities though they must be correct for those overall capabilities to be valid.
