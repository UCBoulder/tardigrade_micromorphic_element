**
** Hex8 Micromorphic Finite Element
**
**------------------------------------------------------------
**
** A micromorphic finite element. The default parameters are 
** set for a linear elastic model which has the same parameters 
** at each node. This element has 8 nodes, and 8 gauss points.
**
** The element is unsymmetric and we also use the state 
** variables to store the current value of the three stress 
** measures and the three deformation measures. This may not be 
** desired for all cases and so, for some analyses, the number 
** of state variables can be reduced.
