The definition of the micromorphic finite element. The theoretical background of the element is detailed extensively in the theory manual as well as publications by Regueiro et. al. The finite element has its subroutines tested extensively to ensure proper function. Currently, tensor is used for the element however these will likely be replaced in the future by vector and matrix representations.
