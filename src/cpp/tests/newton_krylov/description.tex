An implementation of a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov solver as detailed in Sulsky et. al. with some modifications to fix errors in the publications. The solver is used to drive the regression tests which are used in the method of manufactured solutions for the element. The code is verified by solving multi-variate nonlinear root-finding problems.
