A file which computes the stress measures for micromorphic linear elasticity using a voigt notation description. This is done to improve speed from a full tensor representation by reducing the required multiplications significantly through the use of Eigen sparse matricies (eigen.tuxfamily.org) and also to enable the incorporation of the material model into a more broad class of codes.
