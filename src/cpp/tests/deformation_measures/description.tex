A file which converts variable measures from MOOSE (www.mooseframework.org) to micromorphic deformation measures. These deformation measures can then be used in constitutive models in a more natural way. Some additional functionality to computing standard continuum deformation measures is also included. The code is verified by comparison to expected deformation measures.
