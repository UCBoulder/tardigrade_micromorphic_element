\section{Upcoming Enhancements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Discover and remedy bug in fea\_solver.py that is preventing convergence. Suspicions are that the tangent has been implemented incorrectly.
\item Convert tensor representation in C++ code to vector-matrix representation to speed up the code.
\end{enumerate}
