\section{Upcoming Enhancements}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Discover and remedy bug in fea\_solver.py that is preventing convergence. Suspicions are that the tangent has been implemented incorrectly.
\item Determine whether to convert python code to C++ code. This code could be used directly with Abaqus rather than needing to port to Fortran.
\end{enumerate}
