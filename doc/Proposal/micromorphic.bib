title="The Sandia Fracture Challenge: blind round robin predictions of ductile tearing",

abstract="Existing and emerging methods in computational mechanics are rarely validated against problems with an unknown outcome. For this reason, Sandia National Laboratories, in partnership with US National Science Foundation and Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, launched a computational challenge in mid-summer, 2012. Researchers and engineers were invited to predict crack initiation and propagation in a simple but novel geometry fabricated from a common off-the-shelf commercial engineering alloy. The goal of this international Sandia Fracture Challenge was to benchmark the capabilities for the prediction of deformation and damage evolution associated with ductile tearing in structural metals, including physics models, computational methods, and numerical implementations currently available in the computational fracture community. Thirteen teams participated, reporting blind predictions for the outcome of the Challenge. The simulations and experiments were performed independently and kept confidential. The methods for fracture prediction taken by the thirteen teams ranged from very simple engineering calculations to complicated multiscale simulations. The wide variation in modeling results showed a striking lack of consistency across research groups in addressing problems of ductile fracture. While some methods were more successful than others, it is clear that the problem of ductile fracture prediction continues to be challenging. Specific areas of deficiency have been identified through this effort. Also, the effort has underscored the need for additional blind prediction-based assessments.",

    abstract = { Derives a formulation for spatial stress tensors and spatial material tensors of hyperelastic material. Looks at a class of materials with the strain energy function decomposed into a volumetric and a deviatoric part. Separate terms formulate the strain energy with respect to the invariants of the left Cauchy‐Green tensor. Stress and material tensors, which play a crucial role in the solution process of the finite element formulation, are derived solely in the current configuration. Applies the described framework to several different constitutive models based on phenomenologically and physically motivated material descriptions. Proposes a formulation for the finite element implementation of van der Waals material. Compares numerical results with experimental investigations given in the literature. For three‐dimensional finite element computations standard elements and mixed elements, based on a three‐field variational principle where displacements, the hydrostatic pressure and the dilatations are independent variables, are used. }

title="Stable and flux-conserved meshfree formulation to model shocks",
journal="Computational Mechanics",
year="2016",
volume="57",
number="5",
pages="773--792",
abstract="Accurate shock modeling requires that two critical issues be addressed: (1) correct representation of the essential shock physics, and (2) control of Gibbs phenomenon oscillation at the discontinuity. In this work a stable (oscillation limiting) and flux-conserved formulation under the reproducing kernel particle method is developed for shock modeling. A smoothed flux divergence is constructed under the framework of stabilized conforming nodal integration, which is locally-enriched with a Riemann solution to satisfy the entropy production constraints. This Riemann-enriched flux divergence is embedded into the reproducing kernel formulation through a velocity correction that also provides oscillation control at the shock. The correction is constrained to the shock region by an automatic shock detection algorithm that is constructed using the intrinsic spectral decomposition feature of the reproducing kernel approximation. Several numerical examples are provided to verify accuracy of the proposed formulation.",
