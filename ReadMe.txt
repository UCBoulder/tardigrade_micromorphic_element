===============================================

An implementation of a micromorphic hex8 element. The form is 
intended to be used for easy implementation into an Abaqus 
user element (UEL).

Requires default python libraries (python.org) as well as numpy (numpy.org). These packages are 
available for download in a convenient package at www.continuum.io/downloads.

The code can be tested and the documentation generated by issuing the command >python setup.py
where "python" is the call to the python 2.7 installation. The results of the tests can be viewed in
the directory .\doc\Report\

A full test of the code can be executed with the command >python run_tests.py -v

where "python" is the call to the python 2.7 installation. This will run the unittest module 
which will execute the test functions in the code. The -v option allows more information to 
be printed to the screen. This is useful to understand which tests are being executed.

Also requires an installation of LaTeX and Bibtex. It is assumed that the commands for these 
functions are pdflatex and bibtex respectively
